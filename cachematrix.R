## That file contains two functions to calculate the 
#inverse of a matrix which can be inversible.
#The inverse is calculating only in case 
#it is not stored in the cache.

## Function to create a dummy matrix object
#to cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Function to get a matrix inverse
#gets one argument - a inversible matrix x
#returns one object - a matrix which is the inverse of x

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
